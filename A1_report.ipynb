        "# Introduction\n",
        "##The Bayesian network, also known as the Belief Network, or the directed acyclic graphical model, is a probability graph model first developed by Judea Pearl in 1985 put forward. This is an uncertainty processing model that simulates causality in human reasoning. Its network topology is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In the belief network we assign causal (or unconditionally independent) variables or propositions with arrows (in other words, the arrows connecting the two nodes represent whether the two random variables are causal or unconditionally independent). If two nodes are connected by a single arrow, indicating that one of the nodes is \"parents\" and the other is \"children\", the two nodes will generate a conditional probability value (Ben‐Gal, 2008). For example, suppose node E directly affects node H, that is, E→H, and then establishes a directed arc (E, H) from node E to node H with an arrow pointing from E to H, and the weight (ie, the connection strength) is used (Druzdzel & Simon, 1993).\n",

        "##This paper is about the Bayesian belief network to solve some algorithmic problems of computational probability, and proposes a new algorithm design and then discusses whether it can solve the probability calculation problem of belief network. The belief network is currently used in AI technology, which is a machine learning method. However, the multi-connected belief algorithm is difficult to calculate the probability NP, and the algorithm using any topology map for probability estimation cannot solve this problem. Because there are more than one variable and more undirected connections between the connections of multiple belief networks (Cooper, 1990). In this paper, we first introduce the belief network and its probabilistic reasoning, as well as the main challenges - using algorithmic calculations to prove that the probability NP in a multi-connected belief network is difficult to calculate using ordinary algorithms, and should not be given with a higher priority. Finally, the different algorithm design is proposed, which is different from the general effective algorithm. It will use different algorithm calculations for good special-case, average-case and approximation algorithms, and discuss the future research direction.\n",

        "##In the process of proving the probabilistic inference NP-hard, the belief network is first introduced. Any complete probabilistic model must have the ability to represent (directly or indirectly) the joint distribution of variables in the domain. A full enumeration requires an exponential scale (relative to the number of domain variables).\n",
        "##The designation of independence between variables in the network is the key to achieving a compact representation that is particularly effective in constructing Bayesian networks through human experts.\n",

        "##Finally, in the probabilistic reasoning part, it is proved that the belief network is NP-hard and proves that other more general forms of probabilistic reasoning are also NP-hard.\n",

        "##In the proof of NP-hard, the article uses an NP-complete problem (called 3-Satisfiability (3SAT) [5, 10]) to convert into a probabilistic reasoning decision problem (PIBNETD). The decision problem from PIBNETD is a probabilistic reasoning problem that can be directly converted into a simple PIBNET (Cooper, 1990). In the process of proof, this article defines 3SAT and lists specific algorithms to complete 3SAT conversion to PIBNETD, and finally concludes by demonstrating that PIBNET is NP-hard."

In this way, the author expresses that the algorithm using Tutong cannot solve the probability estimation problem of the belief network. Because the multi-connected belief network has multiple connections and multiple uncertain connection directions, a new solution is needed. Get the correct calculation results.\n",

So It can be proved), and 3SAT (3-Satisfiability) is used as an example of a protocol between NP-Complete.\n",

        "##In the general algorithmic inference, the problem of belief network is unsolvable, because the non-directionality and multiple variables cause the polynomial to be unable to get an answer even if it takes astronomical time. For example, the salesperson travel problem is one of the most representative NP problems. Suppose a salesman needs to depart from Beijing, pass through n cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen, and finally return to Beijing. There are direct flights between any two cities, but the fares are not equal. Now suppose the company only reimburses C dollars and asks if there is a itinerary that allows him to traverse all cities, and the total toll is less than C?\n",
        "\n",
        "##The salesman's travel problem is obviously NP's problem. Because if you give an itinerary arbitrarily, you can easily calculate the total travel expenses. However, to know if a trip with a total toll is less than C, in the worst case, all possible travel arrangements must be checked! This will be an astronomical number. If there are seven cities, then there are 6!=720 sorting methods, which are relatively simple, but if there are 20 cities, there are 19! For the reason, in the arrangement of the combination n! It is easy to write. But 1.21∗10171.21∗1017 is a very big number. If it is arranged once every second, it should be 3.84∗1093.84∗109 years (about 3.15∗1073.15∗107 seconds a year), even if you use the calculator, it will be redone every million times (not easy to do). It would take a very long time that you maybe find the answer.\n",

Cooper (1990) uses the conversion method to perform multiple conversions and then uses algorithmic calculations to verify that the belief network is an NP-hard problem, thus drawing conclusions and proposing different algorithms to solve different situations of belief networks. Cooper (1990) uses the 3SAT conversion of the NP-complete problem to solve the problem PIBNETD for algorithm verification, and the decision problem PIBNETD can be directly converted into a simple PIBNETD probability inference to complete the argument. The method of using this transformation can simplify the complicated algorithm problem. It is only necessary to use the 3SAT reduction to simply prove that PIBNETD is topologically restricted and the belief network is NP-hard."

After proving that the belief network is an NP-hard problem, the author concludes that the general and accurate algorithms should not be used for probability estimation. Instead, the replacement strategy needs to be used according to different situations (including good special-case, average-case and approximation algorithms, etc.), the process of converting complex situations into simple calculations. So for this kind of proposal, the use of belief networks in research work in different fields should be studied to determine which appropriate algorithm to use.\n",

If a certain range of reduction errors can be achieved within the allowed time range, this method may be used in some areas (such as medicine) to solve some important empirical problems.\n",

Then, using good special-case algorithms, these multiple connected networks with small node clusters can be used. Perform an efficient algorithm calculation on it."

In the introduction, the author introduces the main research directions of the article, and proves that the NP-hard problem lists enough formulas for the reader to fully understand the basic knowledge of the problem. Although the article uses a large number of algorithmic calculations to prove at the proof stage, the arguments in each of the previous chapters are easy to understand and explain why it is so difficult to calculate such a large number of calculations and direct NP-hard proofs. Moreover, the conversion method is also used in the algorithm proof part to make the reader understand more easily, avoiding the complicated and large amount of calculations and causing the reader to understand the proof process. In general, this is an excellent article with a very professional speech style, a very rigorous logical structure and a high academic depth. It is worth reading carefully when studying such issues.\n"
